# Flocking
Implementation of Craig Reynolds' "Flocking" behavior. See: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/ Rules: Cohesion, Separation, Alignment (from natureofcode.com). This example is taken directly from the p5 website https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html.

My version of this demo can be viewed here: https://andee777.github.io/p5-flocking/
